    <h2>What is SKINDEX?</h2>
    <p>SKINDEX is a token that tracks the Counter Strike skin market. This is maintained by strict 1:1 backing. It operates as a decentralized, ETF-style asset on Ethereum, providing trustless and liquid exposure to in-game items.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Tokenomics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Mint with ETH</li>
      <li>Burn to redeem ETH</li>
      <li>Maximum Fees: 1% developer, 5% mint, 5% burn (adaptive, further details on the roadmap)</li>
      <li>Burn fees are high at first to encourage long term holding</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How Minting Works</h2>
    <p>Users can send ETH to the contract. The contract mints SKINDEX based on NAV minus mint fee and developer fee.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How Burning Works</h2>
    <p>Users can burn SKINDEX to redeem their share of the Vault value, calculated from NAV and minus burn fee. Redemption pulls from the ETH reserve pool.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Pools</h2>
    <p>The Vault contains 3 pools. Counter Strike Skins, ETH, and BTC. ETH is deposited into the contract. This ETH is then used to purchase skins or BTC based on predefined Pool Distribution Algorithms.</p>
    <p>The BTC is to maintain liquidity in the contract to act as a buffer for withdrawals to allow time for selling skins.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Oracle & Transparency</h2>
    <p>All skin deposits are tracked on-chain via bot-oracle reports. BTC and ETH prices come from Chainlink or similar. Vault values and composition are always public and queryable.</p>
  </section>  

  <section>
    <h2>Price Stabilization (Coming Soon)</h2>
    <p>When SKINDEX trades below NAV, the protocol uses BTC to buy back and reduce supply. When above, it sells into the market to capture value and grow the skin vault.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Open-source contracts</li>
      <li>Audits planned before mainnet</li>
      <li>Bot-controlled skin custody with smart contract access only</li>
    </ul>
